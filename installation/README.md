## Installation

In the following, steps for installing an [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) based system with a simple encrypted partition scheme are listed.

#### Guide

1. Preparation
    1. Acquire the ISO file and PGP signature [here](https://archlinux.org/download/).
    2. Verify the checksum by running <code>pacman-key -v archlinux-<i>yyyy.mm.dd</i>-x86_64.iso.sig</code> from an existing system with the date matching the image version.
    3. Write the ISO to a USB flash drive. **This will delete all data stored on the device.**
